# Project Title

My News Application

## Purpose of the App

I wrote this as a Angular 7 App using some reactive responses using RxJS to create a website for all my News. It uses a public API for newsapi.org and uses it's endpoints for gathering news of interest based on filters.  This app also uses Material Design and Core Angular Components.

### What you will need to use this App

Some knowledge of Javascript, Typescript, Angular 7.

```
Angular 2+ knowledge will do actually although there are references to some new components as part of Angular 7. 
```

### Things you would need

Angular CLI tools
NodeJS
Node Package Manager (npm)
NewsAPI Account (Free)
BootStrap
Material Design	
An editor such as Visual Studio, Atom or WebStorm
A modern browser such as Chrome that has Dev Tools to debug code etc.


## Running the code

After you create these code in your local environment and update with a valida APIKey and API Url, do a npm serve to test it.  Then do a npm build and then host your app to a site such as firebase.
